# Covid-cases-in-Sri-Lanka
The Machine Learning model predicts the covid cases for the next 50 days (you can change this to any number of days). 
The final plot displays the 95% confidance interval as well. 
You need to download the code and re-run to obtain the latest forecast. Many thanks to Johns Hopkins University for making this data 
available to public.
